SPLIT = 0
PERSON ONE (for a split between you and a shop owner, this is your own key, use the 'key getter' included in the package):
SPLIT 1 KEY = XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX
PERSON TWO (TEMP DISABLED - change ~ to = to re-establish)
SPLIT 2 KEY ~ XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX
PERSON THREE (TEMP DISABLED - change ~ to = to re-establish)
SPLIT 3 KEY ~ XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX
if split 1 flat is 0 then split 1 amount is a percentage, otherwise it is a flat figure (eg, $10 rather than 10%)
SPLIT 1 FLAT = 0
SPLIT 2 FLAT ~ 0
SPLIT 3 FLAT ~ 0
This is the amount you want back - the owner will retain the rest
SPLIT 1 AMOUNT =90
SPLIT 3 AMOUNT  ~ 10
SPLIT 2 AMOUNT  ~ 15
