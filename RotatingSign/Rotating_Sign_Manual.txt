INTRODUCTION

The Truth & Beauty Lab Rotating Sign is a single prim textured object that rotates about its z-axis, emits a variety of particle displays, and can be configured to deliver a notecard, object, texture, sound, clothing item, script, body part, animation, gesture, and landmark. All that is necessary to deliver items to your guests is to drop them into the sign â€“ it automatically configures itself to deliver items in its contents. The sign can be extensively configured (see below). Actually, the box the product is delivered in is a 3D rotating sign so you get two signs for the price of one!


SETUP

After unpacking the product box and copying the contents to your inventory, simply rez the Truth & Beauty Lab Rotating Sign. By default, it is textured with the Truth & Beauty Lab logo and delivers a notecard providing information on the Truth & Beauty Lab as well as a landmark to the TBL demonstration Pandorabot. You can easily retexture and resize the sign with your own shop logo or custom texture. To deliver your own notecard and landmark simply replace the Truth & Beauty Lab notecard and landmark with any you wish to deliver to your guests. You can also add a texture, object, sound, clothing item, script, body part, animation, or gesture to the Rotating Sign's contents to deliver these as well.


CONFIGURATION

The Truth & Beauty Lab Rotating Sign defaults can be modified by editing the Config notecard in the object's contents. To do so, right click the Rotating Sign object and select "Edit". In the edit window, click on the "Contents" tab. In the Contents tab, right click on the notecard "Config" and select "Open".

Config Notecard Settings

Settings in the Config notecard are specified in the format "<name> = <value>". Do not use "=" in either the <name> or <value>. Place any uncommented configuration settings above the END_SETTINGS line. Lines below END_SETTINGS will not be read and are there for information and help configuring. These comments can be left in the notecard without adversely effecting performance as the script stops reading the notecard when it hits the END_SETTINGS line.

The default settings will work "out of the box" allowing you to simply drop in the items you wish to deliver to your guests. You may wish to customize the sign front and back textures, specify the size, and add a group key to issue group invitations but otherwise most of the defaults should work well as-is.

Note that each category of items to be delivered can only specify a single item in that category. A single notecard or a single texture or a single landmark. If you have multiple items of the same category you wish to deliver (e.g. 3 notecards or 5 textures), simply box these items up and deliver them as an object.

Available configuration settings (with defaults specified where applicable) are as follows:

Whether to rotate about the z-axis

USAGE

The default setting is to greet new arrivals with a message informing them to touch the sign to receive the delivery items. Auto delivery is a Config notecard option. You can also disable the scan for new arrivals to configure the sign to passively deliver items when touched.

FURTHER INFORMATION

The Truth & Beauty Lab creates a variety of scripted objects including artificially intelligent 3D animated avatar bots that can query Wikipedia, provide answers from Wolfram Alpha, greet new arrivals, deliver notecards & landmarks, scan the area for objects and avatars producing a detailed report, follow their owner, emit magnificent particle displays, forward incoming email to IM's, and more.
