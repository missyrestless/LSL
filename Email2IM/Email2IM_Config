END_SETTINGS
#
# Configuration notecard for the Email2IM script.
# Settings are specified in the format "<name> = <value>"
# DO NOT use "=" in either the <name> or <value>
# Place any uncommented configuration settings above the END_SETTINGS
# line above. Lines below END_SETTINGS will not be read and are here
# for information and help configuring.
#
# These comments can be left in the notecard without adversely effecting
# performance as the script stops reading the notecard when it hits the
# END_SETTINGS line so we can put as many comments here as we want.

# The interval (in seconds) at which to check for new email and change shape
#INTERVAL = 120.0
#
# The interval at which the object changes shape (in multiples of INTERVAL).
# The default is 1 which means shape changes occur every INTERVAL seconds. A
# value of 3 would mean shape changes occur every (3 * INTERVAL) seconds. A
# value of 0 disables shape and texture changes.
#MULTIPLE = 1

# Whether to display the hover text over the object

# If you just want a small static box set this to TRUE. If you want the prim
# to rotate and change textures/shape then leave it commented out. Setting this
# to TRUE also sets MULTIPLE above to 0 and SIZE below to small.
#SIMPLE = FALSE
#
# Some size defaults. This can be set to tiny, small, medium, large, XL, or XXL
# which will size the prim to 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, or 4.0 meters on a side
